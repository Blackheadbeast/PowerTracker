# Power Consumption and Activity Monitor (Android)

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive Android application focused on identifying power-hungry tasks and activities in real-time. Additionally, it provides users with the ability to track and analyze historical data, empowering them to make informed decisions about their device usage. The ultimate goal is to optimize power consumption and enhance the overall user experience.

## Methodology

### 1. Gather Project Requirements:

#### Objective:
- Understand the purpose and goals of the application.
- Identify features and functionalities required by end-users.
- Define constraints, such as budget, timeline, and platform compatibility.

#### Activities:
- Stakeholder Meetings: Engage with clients, end-users, and other stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- Requirement Analysis: Analyze gathered information to create a comprehensive list of features and functionalities. Prioritize requirements based on importance and feasibility.

### 2. Rough Sketch, Wireframe, Designs:

#### Objective:
- Visualize the app's structure and layout.
- Create a blueprint for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.
- Obtain early feedback on design concepts.

#### Activities:
- Rough Sketches: Create initial hand-drawn sketches to outline the basic layout and flow of the application.
- Wireframing: Develop digital wireframes using design tools.
- Prototyping: Create interactive prototypes to refine design concepts.

### 3. Code in Java, Kotlin:

#### Objective:
- Implement the application's features based on the finalized design.
- Choose an appropriate programming language (Java or Kotlin for Android development).
- Follow coding best practices to ensure maintainability and scalability.

#### Activities:
- Development: Write code according to the specifications outlined in the requirements and design.
- Version Control: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and manage code versions.
- Code Reviews: Conduct code reviews for quality assurance.

### 4. Verify Code:

#### Objective:
- Ensure the code meets functional and non-functional requirements.
- Identify and fix bugs or issues.
- Conduct thorough testing to validate the app's behavior.

#### Activities:
- Unit Testing: Test individual components or functions.
- Integration Testing: Assess interactions between different components.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Involve end-users in testing.

### 5. Deploy App:

#### Objective:
- Make the application available for end-users.
- Distribute the app through app stores or other deployment channels.
- Monitor the app's performance in a real-world environment.

#### Activities:
- App Deployment: Publish the app on relevant app stores (e.g., Google Play Store).
- Monitoring: Monitor the app's performance, user feedback, and potential issues post-deployment.
- Continuous Improvement: Gather user feedback and plan future updates based on insights gained.
